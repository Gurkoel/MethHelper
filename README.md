# MethHelper
A mod for Payday2 which notifies the player as to which meth ingredient is to be used.  Requires <a href="http://paydaymods.com/download/">BLT</a>.

Mod will print the current required ingredient to the host of the mod (that's you) and nobody else. All messages from MethHelper will be preceeded by the tag "<font color = "green">[MethHelper]</font>".

Works with Cookoff, Rats day 1, Hotline Miami day 1, and Dockyard.
